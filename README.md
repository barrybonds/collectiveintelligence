# README #

This repo contains python programs from selected chapters of the popular book by Toby Segaran book called Collective Intelligence.

My intention is to use this as a medium to learn the concepts described in the book and hopefully other can learn from it and use the algorithms 
described. The challenege now is to document the code and repo such that anyone can appraoch the concepts without reading the entire book.
I'll try to cover more chapters in my spare time.

Please contribute by way of documentation.
